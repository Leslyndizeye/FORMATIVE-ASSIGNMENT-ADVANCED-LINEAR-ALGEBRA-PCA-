## Assignment Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch, along with the application of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We are tasked with reducing the dimensionality of the given dataset (fuel_econ.csv) while retaining as much variance as possible.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Task 1**: PCA Implementation  
   We implemented PCA by computing covariance, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, and projected the data onto the principal components. The implementation was done in Google Colab and we ensured that the output of each code cell was visible as per the assignment instructions.

2. **Task 2**: Dynamic Eigenvalue Selection  
   We dynamically selected the number of principal components based on explained variance. This part helps to reduce the dataset while retaining relevant information.

3. **Task 3**: Performance Optimization  
   Our implementation was optimized for performance, and we handled large datasets effectively to ensure the PCA computations were efficient.

4. **Part 2**: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  
   We calculated the second (λ2) and third (λ3) eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the provided matrix. We also determined the importance of these eigenvalues in percentage form.

## Collaboration Details
- We collaborated using a digital whiteboard (Miro) for discussing and presenting the eigenvalue calculations. Both Chance and Ndizeye contributed distinct handwriting or edits, providing clear proof of collaboration.

## Repo Structure
- `pca_notebook.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook containing the PCA implementation.
- `eigenvalues_answers.pdf`: Handwritten work for Part 2, including eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations and their importance.
- `fuel_econ.csv`: The dataset used for PCA.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `pca_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset and run the PCA implementation.
4. Make sure to upload the `fuel_econ.csv` file when prompted in the notebook.

## Deliverables
- A completed notebook with implemented PCA, dynamic eigenvalue selection, and benchmarking.
- A handwritten on white paper sheet

## Group Details
We are Peer Group 28, working together to solve this advanced linear algebra problem and implement PCA successfully.
